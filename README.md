## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
  - **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data and authentication details.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication and session management.
  - **Passlib**: A library for hashing passwords securely.

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML**: Structured the user interface for registration and login forms.
  - **CSS**: Designed responsive styles for a better user experience.
  - **JavaScript**: Implemented client-side logic for form validation and interactions.

- **Development Tools**:
  - **Postman**: For testing API endpoints and ensuring proper functionality.
  - **Git**: Version control for managing the project codebase.
  - **Render**: Hosting platform for deploying the API.

## üí° Features

- **User Registration**: 
  - Allows users to sign up with a unique email and password.
  - Implements password hashing for security.

- **Email Verification**: 
  - Ensures that users confirm their email addresses upon registration.

- **Login & Logout**: 
  - Securely authenticates users and manages sessions using JWT.
